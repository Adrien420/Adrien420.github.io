After my first classes in Web Technologies, where I discovered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was eager to create a video game using those skills. I made it available online through GitHub and OVH.
<br/> 
Later, I decided to add a multiplayer feature to my game. To do this, I used Firebase, which enabled me to create a leaderboard and store game data for any player registering with a Google account.
