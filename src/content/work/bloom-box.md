After creating my first game, Space Shooter, I wanted to explore the possibilities of developing a game using a game engine. This led me to create Fast & Alive, a 3D racing game against the clock featuring multiple tracks, cars, animations, and music. Through this project, I learned how to use Unity and its built-in functionalities, code in C#, and create 3D models in Blender.
