During my first year of graduate studies in robotics engineering, I worked on a project to design a robot that had to meet specific requirements. 
<br/> 
These specifications included drawing some basic shapes (a line and a circle with solid or dotted line), as well as being controllable by a joystick. 
<br/> 
In a team of 3, we designed the 3D model, determined the models required for robot control, made the programme and built the robot using 3D printing and a laser cutter.
